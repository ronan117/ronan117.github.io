<p>What are they?</p>


<ul>
 <li>They're called inequalities 
   <ol type= "a">
      <li> The Greater Than symbol is &gt; </li>
      <li> The Less Than symbol is &lt; </li>
      
        
   </ol>
 </li>
  
</ul>





  
<ul>
 <li>They're called inequalities 
   <ol>
      <li> The definition is </li>
        <ul><li>The relation between two expressions that are not equal</li></ul>
   </ol>
 </li> 
</ul>

  <p1> You can use the two in equations to signify if a number is Greater than or Less Than another number. </p1>

<h3>How would you use it in an equation?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><p1> 1 &gt; 0, 1 is Greater than 0 because it is a bigger number</p1></li>
    
    <li><p1> 0 &lt; 1, 0 is Less Than 1 because it is a smaller number.</p1> </li>
